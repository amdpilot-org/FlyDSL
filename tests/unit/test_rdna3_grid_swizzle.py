"""GPU-free tests for the RDNA3 GEMM workgroup swizzle.

``_group_width`` / ``_swizzle_tile_id`` map a linear workgroup id onto the tile
grid, walking down M before stepping in N so concurrent workgroups share B tiles
in L2. The mapping must be a bijection onto the grid. It was not, for any grid_m
that the grouping cap did not divide: the last group ran off the end, bid_m
exceeded grid_m, and the kernel wrote past C.

All plain integer arithmetic that runs before a kernel is built, so no GPU is
needed. The device-side counterpart is
``tests/kernels/test_rdna_gemm.py::test_f16_gemm_grid_m_not_a_multiple_of_the_group_width``.
